<h3>What is this thing you call "Arms of Asgard"?</h3>
"Arms of Asgard" (AoA) is a Quake(1996) weapon replacement project by me, Ryan Holaday, based on a mod I completed in the early 2000s that is lost to time and poor archiving practices. During lockdown due to COVID-19, Arms of Asgard served as a nostalgic hobby, but it reignited my passion for games and game design.

<h3>Why does this page exist?</h3>
This GitHub page is designed to illustrate the weapon design and balance choices made throughout Arms of Asgard, and to serve as a portfolio piece for getting into the games industry.

<h2>Project Overview</h3>
AoA replaces all 8 original Quake weapons with fantasy-themed weapons, and provides each weapon with primary, secondary, and tertiary attacks. All weapons were designed with the underlying assertions:
<ol>
  <li>Weapons must be FUN to use.</li>
  <li>Each weapon have a context in which it excels.</li>
  <li>Weapons offer utility in addition to damage.</li>
  <li>No weapon will be as weak as the original Quake axe.</li>
  <li>All weapons will be more balanced (and less progressively potent) than the original Quake weapons; this should make deathmatch more fun.</li>
  <li>These weapons collectively should be compatible with (and viable for) for any "Vanilla Quake" maps from both the original game and community-built maps.</li>
</ol>
